Inspired by [Felix Geisendorfer blog post](https://felixge.de/2017/07/27/implementing-state-machines-in-postgresql.html) I implemented a database FSM (Finite-State Machine) with Postgresql.
I brought some improvements to Felix's implementation but before reading the following I recommend you to read carefully [the original post](https://felixge.de/2017/07/27/implementing-state-machines-in-postgresql.html).

**TL;DR** Here are the changes I did:

  * Introduced a versioning control of the FSM.
  * Optimized performances and data storage.
  * Added some protection against user mistakes

To keep it simple I'll use exactly the same FSM graph than Felix: an ordering process with payment and shipment steps.

### Types optimization

First I replaced the storage of states/events from `text` to `enum`. Because I have a finite number of states and transitions I can properly store them as custom `enum`. It reduces the storage of these to a lighter and constant 4 bytes.

```sql
CREATE TYPE order_state AS ENUM (
  'start',
  'awaiting_payment',
  'awaiting_shipment',
  'awaiting_refund',
  'shipped',
  'canceled',
  'error'
);
CREATE TYPE order_event AS ENUM (
  'create',
  'pay',
  'ship',
  'refund',
  'cancel'
);
```

If later I have to add new state or event I can easily do:

```sql
ALTER TYPE order_event ADD VALUE 'my_new_event';
```

Obviously it impacts the `order_events` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_events (
  id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  event order_event NOT NULL DEFAULT 'create',
  time timestamp DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);
```

As you noticed I replaced the `order_id` type from `INT` to `uuid`. In brief because it's out of scope: [I never use serial for fields going out of database](https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/engineering/2015/05/20/why-auto-increment-is-a-terrible-idea/).

### Transition mechanism improvements

In his implementation, Felix Geisendorfer is using a `switch` statement to implement the state transition.
It's a fine and straightforward solution. However, if you have more states/events it could become hard to maintain. Furthermore if you want to version your FSM, you'll often have to `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`.
Instead I created a _mapping table_ with 3 columns:

  * `state`: the current state
  * `event`: the event which causes the transition
  * `next_state`: the resulting state

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_events_transitions (
  state      order_state NOT NULL,
  event      order_event NOT NULL,
  next_state order_state NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (state, event, next_state)
);
```

_AN: I can limit transitions to only one path for two given states with `PRIMARY KEY (state, event)`._

Any transition which is not in this table will be resolved as `error` state in our new transition function:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION order_events_transition(_state order_state, _event order_event)
RETURNS order_state LANGUAGE sql AS $$
SELECT COALESCE(
  (SELECT next_state FROM order_events_transitions WHERE state=_state AND event=_event),
  'error'::order_state
);
$$;
```

_AN: There is maybe a better way then "COALESCE" to implement the "default"..._


OK! It's now time to write valid transitions:

```sql
INSERT INTO order_events_transitions VALUES
  ('start',             'create', 'awaiting_payment' ),
  ('awaiting_payment',  'pay',    'awaiting_shipment'),
  ('awaiting_payment',  'cancel', 'canceled'         ),
  ('awaiting_shipment', 'cancel', 'awaiting_refund'  ),
  ('awaiting_shipment', 'ship',   'shipped'          ),
  ('awaiting_refund',   'refund', 'canceled'         );
```

### FSM graph versioning

In real life my use cases and business processes are moving (fast). Probably yours as well.
Since the FSM I build is the implementation of this processes, each change IRL impacts my database design.

For instance a state `awaiting_approval` could be added before allowing to pay.

If I change my transition function and table without taking care of past `order_events`, I will completly break my FSM. Indeed because I'm moving the `create` event, all the already recorded transitions will raise an `error` state. It's not [maintainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability)!

> How to handle multiple versions of my FSM graph ?

Introducing version control in my design will solve this issue.

First I create a table to store the versions and their status:

```sql
CREATE TYPE order_fsm_version_status AS ENUM (
  'live',
  'deprecated',
  'obsolete'
);
CREATE TABLE order_fsm_versions(
  version integer GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  status  order_fsm_version_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'live'
);
```

In the meanwhile I create a function to get the last FSM up-and-running version:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION order_fsm_last_version()
RETURNS integer LANGUAGE sql AS $$
SELECT version FROM order_fsm_versions WHERE status='live' ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 1;
$$;
```
Both `order_events` and `order_events_transitions` will need to reference this version:

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_events (
  id       bigint      GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id uuid        NOT NULL DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  event    order_event NOT NULL DEFAULT 'create',
  version  integer     NOT NULL DEFAULT order_fsm_last_version(),
  time     timestamp   NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  FOREIGN KEY (version) REFERENCES order_fsm_versions(version)
);

CREATE TABLE order_events_transitions (
  state      order_state NOT NULL,
  event      order_event NOT NULL,
  version    integer     NOT NULL DEFAULT order_fsm_last_version(),
  next_state order_state NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (state, event, version, next_state),
  FOREIGN KEY (version) REFERENCES order_fsm_versions(version)
);
```

The transition function and its aggregate also have to take care of this version number:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION order_events_transition(
  _state order_state,
  _event order_event,
  _version integer DEFAULT order_fsm_last_version()
) RETURNS order_state LANGUAGE sql AS $$
  SELECT COALESCE(
    (SELECT next_state
     FROM order_events_transitions
     WHERE state=_state AND event=_event AND version=_version),
    'error'::order_state);
$$;
CREATE AGGREGATE order_events_fsm(order_event, integer) (
  SFUNC = order_events_transition,
  STYPE = order_state,
  INITCOND = 'start'
);
```

And finally we have to restrict some transitions according to version status. It is done in the `order_events_trigger`:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION order_events_trigger_func() RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
DECLARE
  next_state order_state;
  transition_status order_fsm_version_status;
BEGIN
  SELECT status FROM order_fsm_versions WHERE version=new.version INTO transition_status;
  IF transition_status = 'deprecated'::order_fsm_version_status THEN
    RAISE NOTICE 'version % is deprecated', new.version;
  END IF;
  IF transition_status = 'obsolete'::order_fsm_version_status THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'version % is obsolete', new.version;
  END IF;

  SELECT order_events_fsm(event, version ORDER BY id)
  FROM (
    SELECT id, event, version FROM order_events WHERE order_id = new.order_id
    UNION
    SELECT new.id, new.event, new.version
  ) s
  INTO next_state;

  IF next_state = 'error'::order_state THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'invalid order event';
  END IF;

  RETURN new;
END
$$;
```

I can now introduce new versions of my FSM graph and deprecate previous one. When I insert row in `order_events` it is using by default the last `live` version of the graph.

```sql
INSERT INTO order_fsm_versions (version, status) VALUES (2, 'live') RETURNING *;
UPDATE order_fsm_versions SET status='deprecated' WHERE version = 1;

INSERT INTO order_events_transitions (state, event, next_state, version) VALUES
  ('start',             'create',  'awaiting_approval', 2),
  ('awaiting_approval', 'approve', 'awaiting_payment',  2),
  ('awaiting_payment',  'pay',     'awaiting_shipment', 2),
(...)

INSERT INTO order_events (order_id, event, time) VALUES
  ('0d687d74-bab3-4c76-beed-0f55ec8a3af2', 'create',  '2017-07-23 00:00:00'),
  ('0d687d74-bab3-4c76-beed-0f55ec8a3af2', 'approve', '2017-07-23 00:00:00'),
  ('0d687d74-bab3-4c76-beed-0f55ec8a3af2', 'pay',     '2017-07-23 12:00:00');
```


### Conclusion

I wrote [a small SQL script which is testing all these features](/resources/pgfsm.sql). I hope it's useful even if you can't use it out of the box. Let me know if [you have feedback](https://github.com/rmedaer/rmedaer.github.io/issues).

Finally, keep in mind that it is still experimental. Consider it as a POC and not like something production-ready!

R.
